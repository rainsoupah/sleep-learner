1.) is designed by the Common Core architect himself (David Coleman),<br>

3.) denies non-Common Core students opportunities to attend colleges,<br>

  5.) ends teaching innovations and advances outside the Common Core, <br>

  6.) dumbs down education to a one-size-fits-all Common Core,<br>7.) sets up kids to fail
